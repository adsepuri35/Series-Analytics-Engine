# Series-Analytics-Engine
Distributed Time-Series Analytics Platform. Work in Progress (WIP). Public repository to keep me accountable.

Here's a planned roadmap:

## Phase 1: Foundation and Data Ingestion
1. Develop a custom kernel module for ultra-low latency network I/O
2. Implement write-ahead logging (WAL) or in-memory buffering
3. Create efficient data formatting for optimal compression

## Phase 2: Distributed Time-Series Database
1. Design data sharding strategy by collection point and time period
2. Implement time-based indexing for quick data retrieval
3. Develop intelligent indexing strategies for enhanced write performance

## Phase 3: Real-Time Analytics Engine
1. Build a distributed stream processing system
2. Implement filtering, aggregation, and grouping functions
3. Integrate with the time-series database for consistent real-time and historical data handling

## Phase 4: Predictive Modeling Subsystem
1. Develop machine learning models for price prediction and anomaly detection
2. Implement transfer learning models to improve forecast accuracy
3. Optimize models for low-latency inference

## Phase 5: Adaptive Resource Management
1. Create an intelligent scheduler for dynamic resource allocation
2. Implement DDS (Data Distribution Service) protocol for network communication
3. Develop efficient IPC mechanisms for nodes on the same machine

## Phase 6: Low-Latency Inter-Process Communication
1. Design custom IPC using shared memory and lock-free data structures
2. Implement Unix Domain Sockets for reduced overhead
3. Optimize shared memory techniques for application-kernel communication

## Phase 7: Visualization and Reporting Interface
1. Develop a real-time dashboard for system monitoring
2. Integrate with visualization tools for interactive dashboards
3. Implement data export and sharing capabilities

## Phase 8: Testing and Optimization
1. Conduct thorough testing for microsecond-level latencies
2. Optimize memory management and CPU scheduling
3. Implement and test fault tolerance and data consistency measures

## Phase 9: Deployment and Scaling
1. Set up cloud infrastructure for scalability
2. Implement both vertical and horizontal scaling solutions
3. Develop data retention policies and time-based aggregation features
